*   ### No state

    Being stateless means that user information is not store into server's memory. Each request is
    independent of each other. The client request can be passed to any of your servers randomly.

*   ### Server up. Server down.

    With the stateless design new servers can be popped up and down on demand. On peak hours you may
    have 10 servers running serving millions of users and on slow hours 2-3 servers can do the job.

*   ### Little or no work

    Be stateless right from the beginning. There is no additional work. You are just ready to scale when
    needed. As a purist you want to [be static]({{content_url('static-websites.html')}}) and
    [build services]({{content_url('services.html')}}).
