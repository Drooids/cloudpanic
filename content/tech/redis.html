        Redis can still perform over 100.000 persistent
        write operations in a second.

*   ### Disks will kill you

    Tape operations killed us in the past. Now it's disk IO.
    Forget them. RAM is the future. Macbook Air does not have
    disks. Redis performs everything in memory. Why? It's so fast
    that it scares you.

*   ### Relational is hard(er)

    Redis datatypes are humane. Lists, maps and sets are native
    for us programmers. Tables, columns, and rows are not not. We
    need to use use hacks or middleware to make them feel natural.

*   ### WTF. From Italy?

    Salvatore Sanfilippo - the amazing head developer of Redis comes
    from Italy! This corrupted country where people mostly care about
    the clothes they wear. I'm from Finland where MySQL was born.
    Something is terribly wrong.
