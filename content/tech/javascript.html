===facts===

*   ### Growing fastest

    From all programming languages JavaScript is growing fastest. Jobs, sold books, libraries and patterns.
    The browser war accelerates the performance and quality of the language. You can do everything with it
    and a lot more in the future.

*   ### Server side magic

    Take a good look at node.js. The most amazing server side product since Apache. All of a sudden the vast
    amount of JavaScript coders can do blazing fast server side products that support thousands of concurrent
    connections.  JavaScript is not for browsers anymore.

*   ### Future proof

    For as long there will be browsers there will be JavaScript. You can be sure that this technology will
    never die. Web sockets and web workers will change how browser applications are developed in the future.
