<div class="fact">
	<h3>Disgusting products</h3>
	
	<p>
		People use features they understand. From the buttons and wigdets
	 	only the few obvious ones are used. The rest just make the product uglier and harder to use.
		Be it a remote control or a website. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="fact">
	<h3>Life pollution</h3>
	
	<p>
		Coding, testing, documentation, meetings, meetings, maintenance and a pathetic release party. 
		Features pollute your life. In the worst case a feature never reached the audience. When you plan
		your next killer feature remove an existing crap instead. 
	</p>
</div>	

<div class="fact">
	<h3>Competitive disadvantage</h3>

	<p>	
		The glory days of features are over. You cannot compete with them. Far from that. The new
		mammoths are based on a really simple idea but they just do it ridiculously better than anyone else. 
		Think of Google, Twitter or Apple.
