*   ### Hierarchy

    Here is the point: write a table of contents of what you do. Put pieces into their right places.
    From top to bottom. Repeat. Don't ever forget this. With an unclear hierarchy your UI (and life) is a mess.

*   ### Minimalism

    It's not about fancy buttons or nice gradients. It's about removing them. Go down to the bare minimum.
    Be bold. Remove everything non-essential. Your ADHD audience wants to know the core immediately. They
    hate screen noise.

*   ### No usability labs

    Usability labs are an overkill. They are like meetings. Waste of time. You have a bad hierarchy or
    screen noise and you know it. This laziness or uncertainty will cost you. Just ask your friend to try when
    you're ready.

*   ### It's everywhere

    Documentation, copywriting, features, business plans and the website. Even a programming API has an
    UI where same rules apply: proper hierarchy, less methods, less arguments less configuration. Get to
    know user interfaces now.
