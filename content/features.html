======//facts\\======

### Disgusting products

People use features they understand. From the buttons and widgets
only the few obvious ones are used. The rest just make the product uglier and harder to use.
Be it a remote control or a website.

### Life pollution

Coding, testing, documentation, meetings, meetings, maintenance and a pathetic release party.
Features pollute your life. In the worst case a feature never reached the audience. When you plan
your next killer feature remove an existing crap instead.

### Competitive disadvantage

The glory days of features are over. You cannot compete with them. Far from that. The new
mammoths are based on a really simple idea but they just do it ridiculously better than anyone else.
Think of Google, Twitter or Apple.
