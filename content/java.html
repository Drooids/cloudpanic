<div class="fact">

	<h3>Never amazing</h3>
	
	<p>					
		During the life of Java nobody ever implemented large or successfull website with it. You can find many PHP or Ruby sites but no Java. The idea of a sexy Swing application is a joke. When it comes to serious development people just didn't use Java.
	</p>

<div class="fact">

	<h3>Lot's of crap</h3>
	
	<p>
		EJB is too complex, Swing is ugly, JSF was dead when it was introduced and JavaFX will never make it. Groovy or Scala are noteworthly but they are a large step away from Java. I hear stories about Java being used succesfully. Great. So great. 
	</p>

<div class="fact">

	<h3>All trends go down</h3>
	
	<p>
		Java bloggers and communities dead. Exitement and innovation is gone. On October 2010 Apple announced that they stop supporting Java. Even Apache may walk away. The situation is fatal. Java is too big to die but it's already our new COBOL.
