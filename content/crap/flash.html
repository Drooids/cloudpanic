===facts===

*   ### Closed system

    Flash is owned and controlled by Adobe. It's a closed system. Every day it is being replaced with HTML.
    Native code is faster, smoother and less buggy. Standards always win.

*   ### It's only the video

    Video playback keeps Flash alive. HTML5 has video tag but it lacks streaming, embedding and camera support.
    Without those Flash would be dead by now. On other areas Flash communities are silent.

*   ### Steve Jobs

    Apple drops the support for Flash. This is not a small one. Programmers move away from risky technology.
    They want to be part of a vibrant ecosystem and secure their future. The future is in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
