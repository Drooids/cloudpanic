*   ### Connecting people

    Symbian, MeeGo, OVI, N9, XY-who-cares-01 ... Millions of hours and billions of dollars.
    Now trashed, forgotten or slowly dying. Major consequences are yet to come.

*   ### Microsoft

    The world is open and they married Microsoft. Luckily the aging 50+ lead shares the same vision:
    features over quality, shareholders over users, leaders over labor and 1000+ almost products instead of handful
    of awesomeness. Congratulations.

*   ### The End.

    Think of Android for a second. Huge open source community backed up by Google. Five more years and they are leaping.
    Only way to compete is by being radically different. When Nokia gets innovative they switch from gray suits to t-shirts. 
    They want to look like Steve Jobs.
