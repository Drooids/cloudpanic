===facts===

*   ### Never amazing

    During the life of Java nobody ever implemented large or successful website with it. You can find many
    PHP or Ruby sites but no Java. The idea of a sexy Swing application is a joke. When it comes to serious
    development people just didn't use Java.

*   ### Lot's of crap

    EJB is too complex, Swing is ugly, JSF was dead when it was introduced and JavaFX will never make it.
    Groovy or Scala are noteworthly but they are a large step away from Java. I hear stories about Java
    being used successfully. Great. So great.

*   ### All trends go down

    Java bloggers and communities dead. Excitement and innovation is gone. On October 2010 Apple announced
    that they stop supporting Java. Even Apache may walk away. The situation is fatal. Java is too big to
    die but it's already our new COBOL.
