*   ### It's a sad story, really

    SAP, IBM or a local company builds your system. Big talks, commercial licenses, ten servers and
    "enterprise level" quality. Cognac maybe. Hope you did well. The majority failed. Completely.


*   ### Massive waste of money

    Problems after problems. Consultant after consultant. Private servers and backups. Licenses, contracts,
    training, seminars &hellip; They will rob you. No excitement. Just the money.

*   ### Insanely complex

    Closed, complex and large. From top to bottom. Millions of lines of messy code: Java, XML, even Cobol.
    "Enterprise Edition 2.0 blah, blah &hellip;" Horrible user interfaces. People go crazy or become zombies.
