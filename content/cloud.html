===facts===
*   ### Cloud computing

    Cloud applications are elastic. The more traffic you have the more CPU, disc and memory is provided.
    Automatically. Your application can serve every person on the globe, not just a small group.

*   ### Cloud services

    This site's source code is on Github, Dropbox is used for previewing, Flickr for image serving, Google Analytics
    for tracking, Facebook and Twitter for spreading the word. Everything is free and immediate. Today free lunch
    truly exists.

*   ### The new world

    New emerging organizations grow themselves on the cloud. Cheaper, simpler, more secure, flexible and automated.
    The hard work is done for you. You pay for what you use or nothing. Complex enterprise solutions cannot compete.
