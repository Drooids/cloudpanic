======//facts\\======

*   ### The old world

    SAP is the mother of [enterprise solutions]({{content_url('enterprise-solutions.html')}}).
    Our case study. Large scale marketing targeted for management who does not understand technology.
    Developers are invited when the deal is already made. What a sad start.

*   ### But others use it

    Congratulations: this is your chance. Let your competitors fall with bad technology, hire endless
    amount of consultants and Pay Big Time. Obviously you step aside and choose differently. You don't
    want to outsource your business and lose control.

*   ### The Alternative

    SAP "consultants" must be far when big decisions are made. What do you really need? Do you need a large mess?
    No. Use the [Cloud]({{content_url('cloud.html')}}), open source and common sense. Be creative. Try Basecamp.
    Hire real talent from Github. Remember: even a shared text file in Dropbox is superior to SAP.

*   ### IBM

    While SAP is the biggest and greatest you can be seriously exploited by IBM too. Depressing products
    like Lotus Notes, DB2 and WebSphere will damage any given business. With the time invested your would
    have been in a very different position by now.
