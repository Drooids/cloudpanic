======//facts\\======

*   ### Back to the future

    From static websites to dynamic and now back to static again. The trick is to _generate_ the
    site before served. Modern tools do templating and CSS/JavaScript minification.

*   ### JavaScript magic

    Build dynamics with JavaScript. Place your logic into [services]({{content_url('services.html')}})
    and use AJAX. This results to the best overall design. The role of a website is to serve content.
    Nothing more.

*   ### Unexpected benefits

    Nothing is faster than a static content and static site never crashes. Caching is easy and content can
    be stored to Github. These pages are static.
