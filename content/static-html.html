<div class="fact">
	<h3>Back to the future</h3>
	
	<p>
		From static websites to dynamic and now back to static again. The trick is to <em>generate</em> the site before served. Modern tools do templating and CSS/JavaScript minification. 
	</p> 
</div>			

<div class="fact"> 
	<h3>JavaScript magic</h3>
	
	<p>
		Build dynamics with JavaScript. Place your logic into <a href="services.html">services</a> and use AJAX. This results to the best overall design. The role of a website is to serve content. Nothing more.
	</p> 
</div>			

<div class="fact">
	<h3>Unexpected benefits</h3>
	
	<p>					
		Nothing is faster than a static content and static site never crashes. Caching is easy and content can be stored to Github. These pages are static. 
	</p>
